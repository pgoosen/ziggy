# Overview
Thanks to an **Offerzen** hackathon, we designed a game using the **Investec Progammable Banking API** and using Slack to facilitate communications.

# The rationale
Many people struggle to build good financial habits thanks to the ease of shopping online and the instant gratification they receive, which is more alluring than watching a savings account grow a few cents at time.We want to help users build better financial awareness, one habit at a time, using gamification to incentivise good habits. Our solution gives users a fun and practical way of developing better spending habits, through individualised objectives and instant progress feedback.
